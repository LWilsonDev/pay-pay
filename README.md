#### Pay-Pay - A digital wallet app (frontend) - WIP

### Aims

- Build a React Native app following a UI design
- Experiment with frontend libraries

I purchased this [UI Kit by pixelz-studio](https://ui8.net/pixelz-studio/products/paypay) that had Figma files for over 80 screens for a fictional finance app 'Pay-Pay'. I liked the designs and thought there was lots of room to experiment with some features such as graphs and sign-up options.

I wanted to build the app to improve my frontend knowledge, in particular, using Tailwind with React Native for styling. I also wanted to explore different options for interactive graphs and forms. I have written about a few of my findings so far in [my blog](https://lwilsondev.co.uk/)

### Features and stack

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- React Hook Forms
- Reanimated
- Expo
